All in the golden afternoon
  Full leisurely we glide;
For both our oars, with little skill,
  By little arms are plied,
While little hands make vain pretence
  Our wanderings to guide.



Ah, cruel Three! In such an hour,
  Beneath such dreamy weather,
To beg a tale of breath too weak
  To stir the tiniest feather!
Yet what can one poor voice avail
  Against three tongues together?



Imperious Prima flashes forth
  Her edict 'to begin it' –
In gentler tone Secunda hopes
  'There will be nonsense in it!' –
While Tertia interrupts the tale
  Not <em>more</em> than once a minute.



Anon, to sudden silence won,
  In fancy they pursue
The dream-child moving through a land
  Of wonders wild and new,
In friendly chat with bird or beast –
  And half believe it true.



And ever, as the story drained
  The wells of fancy dry,
And faintly strove that weary one
  To put the subject by,
"The rest next time -" "It <em>is</em> next time!"
  The happy voices cry.



Thus grew the tale of Wonderland:
  Thus slowly, one by one,
Its quaint events were hammered out –
  And now the tale is done,
And home we steer, a merry crew,
  Beneath the setting sun.



Alice! a childish story take,
  And with a gentle hand
Lay it were Childhood's dreams are twined
  In Memory's mystic band,
Like pilgrim's wither'd wreath of flowers
  Pluck'd in a far-off land.

## Chapter I
### DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE

ALICE was beginning to get very tired of  
sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having  
nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into  
the book her sister was reading, but it had no  
pictures or conversations in it, “ and what is

I can kick a little !”
She drew her foot as
far down the chimney as
she could, and waited till
she heard a little animal
(she couldn ’t guess of
what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about
in the chimney close above
her : then, saying to herself, “This is Bill,” she
gave one sharp kick, and
waited to see what would
happen next.
The first thing she
heard was a general
chorus of “There goes
Bill !” then the Rabbit’s
voice alone—“Catch him,
you by the hedge !” then
