All in the golden afternoon
  Full leisurely we glide;
For both our oars, with little skill,
  By little arms are plied,
While little hands make vain pretence
  Our wanderings to guide.



Ah, cruel Three! In such an hour,
  Beneath such dreamy weather,
To beg a tale of breath too weak
  To stir the tiniest feather!
Yet what can one poor voice avail
  Against three tongues together?



Imperious Prima flashes forth
  Her edict 'to begin it' –
In gentler tone Secunda hopes
  'There will be nonsense in it!' –
While Tertia interrupts the tale
  Not <em>more</em> than once a minute.



Anon, to sudden silence won,
  In fancy they pursue
The dream-child moving through a land
  Of wonders wild and new,
In friendly chat with bird or beast –
  And half believe it true.



And ever, as the story drained
  The wells of fancy dry,
And faintly strove that weary one
  To put the subject by,
"The rest next time -" "It <em>is</em> next time!"
  The happy voices cry.



Thus grew the tale of Wonderland:
  Thus slowly, one by one,
Its quaint events were hammered out –
  And now the tale is done,
And home we steer, a merry crew,
  Beneath the setting sun.



Alice! a childish story take,
  And with a gentle hand
Lay it were Childhood's dreams are twined
  In Memory's mystic band,
Like pilgrim's wither'd wreath of flowers
  Pluck'd in a far-off land.

## Chapter I
### DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE

ALICE was beginning to get very tired of  
sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having  
nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into  
the book her sister was reading, but it had no  
pictures or conversations in it, “ and what is

this fireplace is narrow,  
to be sure, but I _think_ 
I can kick a little !”  
She drew her foot as  
far down the chimney as  
she could, and waited till  
she heard a little animal  
(she couldn ’t guess of  
what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about  
in the chimney close above  
her : then, saying to herself, “This is Bill,” she  
gave one sharp kick, and  
waited to see what would  
happen next.  
The first thing she  
heard was a general  
chorus of “There goes  
Bill !” then the Rabbit’s  
voice alone—“Catch him,  
you by the hedge !” then

as she could, and soon found herself safe in a  
thick wood.  
“ The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice  
to herself, as she wandered about in the wood,  
“ is to grow to my right size again ; and the  
second thing is to find my way into that lovely  
garden. I think that will be the best plan.”  
It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and  
very neatly and simply arranged ; the only  
difficulty was, that she had not the smallest  
idea how to set about it ; and while she was  
peering about anxiously among the trees, a  
little sharp bark just over her head made her  
look up in a great hurry.  
An enormous puppy was looking down at  
her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching  
out one paw, trying to touch her. “ Poor little  
thing !” said Alice in a coaxing tone, and she  
tried hard to whistle to it, but she was terribly  
frightened all the time at the thought that it  
might be hungry, in which case it would be very  
likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.

Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up  
a little bit of stick, and held it out to the  
puppy ; whereupon the puppy jumped into the  
air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of

 “ They all can,” said the Duchess ; “ and  
most of ’em do.”  
“ I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said  
very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got  
into a conversation.  
“ You don’t know much,” said the Duchess ;  
“ and that ’s a fact.”  
Alice did not at all like the tone of this  
remark, and thought it would be as well to  
introduce some other subject of conversation.  
While she was trying to fix on one, the cook  
took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at  
once set to work throwing everything within  
her reach at the Duchess and the baby—the  
fire-irons came first ; then followed a shower  
of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess  
took no notice of them even when they hit her ;  
and the baby was howling so much already, that  
it was quite impossible to say whether the  
blows hurt it or not.  
“ Oh, _please_ mind what you ’re doing !” cried  
Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of

terror. “ Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose !” as  
an unusually large saucepan flew close by it,  
and very nearly carried it off.  
“ If everybody minded their own business,”  
said the Duchess in a hoarse growl, “ the world  
would go round a deal faster than it does.”  
“ Which would _not_ be an advantage,” said  
Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity  
of showing off a little of her knowledge. “ Just  
think of what work it would make with the day  
and night ! You see the earth takes twenty-four  
hours to turn round on its axis——”  
“ Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “ chop  
off her head !”  
Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook,  
to see if she meant to take the hint ; but the  
cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not  
to be listening, so she went on again : “ Twenty-  
four hours, I _think_ ; or is it twelve ? I——”  
“ Oh, don’t bother _me_,” said the Duchess ; “ I  
never could abide figures.” And with that she  
began nursing her child again, singing a sort of

The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on  
hearing this; but all he said was, “Why is a  
raven like a writing-desk ?”  
“ Come, we shall have some fun now !”  
thought Alice. “I ’m glad they’ve begun ask-  
ing riddles—I believe I can guess that,” she  
added aloud.  
“Do you mean that you think you can find  
out the answer to it ?” said the March Hare.  
“Exactly so,” said Alice.  
“Then you should say what you mean,” the
